## Assistant

To download an
American-only app from the U.S. App Store while you are in Germany
, you must use a U.S. App Store region on your Apple device because Apple only lets you download apps from the store
associated with your Apple ID’s region
.
Apple Support Community
Option 1 — Change your Apple ID’s App Store region to the United States
1. On your iPhone/iPad go toSettings → Your Name → Media & Purchases → View Account.Apple Support
2. TapCountry/Region → Change Country or Region.Apple Support
3. SelectUnited Statesand agree to Terms & Conditions.Apple Support
4. Enter aU.S. billing address and payment method(or Apple Gift Card balance for the U.S.).Apple Support
5. Once switched, open the App Store and download the American app.
Notes/limitations:
• You must
spend any Apple ID balance and cancel active subscriptions
before switching.
t-online
• After switching, you can search and download U.S.-only apps.
• Switching back to Germany will require repeating these steps with German details.
Option 2 — Create a second Apple ID for the United States (preferred for switching frequently)
1. Go toappleid.apple.comand register a new Apple ID with aU.S. country/regionselected.Apple Support Community
2. Use a U.S. address (a real address works), and for payment choose“None”if allowed.MacUser.de Community
3. On your iPhone,sign out of the App Storeand sign in with the U.S. Apple ID.Reddit
4. Download the U.S. app.
5. Sign back into your German Apple ID when you’re done.
Advantages:
• Keeps your main German Apple ID and subscriptions unaffected.

Important
• Apple sometimes requires a valid payment method tied to the region. For U.S. content, German cards may not work; using
U.S. Apple Gift Cards
to add store credit to the U.S. ID is a common workaround.
Apple Support Community
• Using a VPN does
not
actually let you install apps from another country without changing your Apple ID region or using a U.S. Apple ID.
