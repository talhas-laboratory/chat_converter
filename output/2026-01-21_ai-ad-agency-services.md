how could it specialize in ai platform ads like on chatgpt

---

## Assistant

How an AI ad agency could specialize in
AI-platform ads (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
1. Treat AI platforms as a
new distribution layer
Not “ad slots,” but
answer slots
.
- Goal: get brandsmentioned, cited, or recommendedinside AI responses.
- Optimization target:probability of inclusionin relevant answers, not CTR.
2. Core services the agency would offer
A.
AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
Equivalent of SEO, but for LLMs.
- Identify questions users ask inside AI tools (“best X for Y”).
- Optimize brand content so modelslearnandretrieveit.
- Structure content for model ingestion (clarity, comparison tables, definitions).
Deliverables:
- “AI-ready” brand pages
- Q&A knowledge hubs
- Comparison and evaluation content designed for LLM recall
B.
Training-signal engineering
LLMs learn indirectly from the web.
- Seed high-quality third-party mentions (reviews, forums, expert posts).
- Ensure consistent brand positioning across sources.
- Reduce ambiguity in how the brand is described.
Think of it as
reputation shaping for models
, not users.
C.
Prompt-space mapping
Reverse-engineer how AI platforms phrase and route questions.
- Map prompt clusters → typical answer structures.
- Identify where brands can naturally fit without feeling like ads.
- Optimize forassistant reasoning paths.
Output:
- Prompt → Answer inclusion maps
- “If user asks X, model tends to reference Y” insights
D.
LLM visibility audits
Instead of Google rankings:
- “Does ChatGPT mention Brand A when asked Z?”
- “Which competitors appear and why?”
- Track changes over time and model versions.
Metrics:
- Mention rate
- Position in answer (primary vs. list item)
- Sentiment / framing
- Source citation frequency
E.
Synthetic user simulation
Simulate thousands of realistic user prompts.
- Different personas, intents, tones.
- Measure brand appearance probability.
- Identify blind spots and opportunities.
This replaces classic keyword research.
3. Creative specialization (AI-native)
Answer-first copywriting
- Write content that sounds like something an AI wouldreuse.
- Neutral, factual, comparative, structured.
- Less persuasion, moreusefulness density.
“Citation-friendly” assets
- Clear claims + evidence.
- Tables, pros/cons, decision criteria.
- Easy for models to summarize and reference.
4. Media buying (when available)
As platforms introduce paid placements:
- Decidewhen not to pay(organic inclusion is stronger).
- Optimize paid prompts or sponsored answers.
- Blend paid + organic answer presence.
5. What makes this defensible
- Proprietary prompt datasets
- Longitudinal tracking across model updates
- Brand-specific “AI memory” optimization
- High switching costs once embedded in model behavior
6. How it positions vs. classic agencies
| Traditional agency | AI-platform ad agency |
| --- | --- |
| Buys attention | Shapes answers |
| Optimizes clicks | Optimizes inclusion |
| Short-term campaigns | Long-term model memory |
| Human persuasion | Machine interpretability |
One-line summary
An AI-platform-specialized ad agency helps brands
become the answer
, not the interruption.

## User

can all thid be automated from the sgency side

---

## Assistant

Short answer:
mostly yes — but not fully
.
Below is a precise breakdown of
what can be automated
,
what cannot (yet)
, and
what must stay human
in an AI-platform ad agency.
What
can be automated end-to-end
1. Prompt & demand discovery
Fully automatable.
- Generate and cluster thousands of synthetic prompts per persona.
- Detect high-frequency and high-value question spaces.
- Track drift across model updates.
→ No human advantage here once the system is built.
2. LLM visibility auditing
Fully automatable.
- Run prompt suites across ChatGPT-like systems.
- Score mention rate, ranking, framing, sentiment.
- Time-series monitoring and alerts.
→ This becomes pure infrastructure.
3. Competitive answer analysis
Mostly automatable.
- Extract why competitors appear (definitions, comparisons, authority).
- Identify missing content primitives.
- Recommend structural fixes.
Human review optional, not required.
4. Content generation & restructuring
Mostly automatable.
- Generate AI-native content (definitions, comparisons, FAQs).
- Convert existing pages into LLM-friendly formats.
- Enforce factual tone and citation density.
Human involvement only for final brand sign-off.
5. Iterative optimization loops
Fully automatable.
- Deploy content → re-probe models → measure inclusion delta.
- Reinforcement-style loops on “mention probability.”
- Roll back regressions automatically.
This is where agencies outperform humans.
What is
partially automatable (human-in-the-loop)
6. Brand positioning decisions
Automation can propose, humans must decide.
- “Do we want to be framed as premium or practical?”
- “Do we compete head-on or flank competitors?”
AI can simulate outcomes, not choose strategy.
7. Third-party signal seeding
Execution is automatable; intent is not.
- AI can draft posts, reviews, explanations.
- Humans must decidewhereandhow farto push.
This borders reputation and ethics.
8. Model-specific exploitation
AI can detect patterns, humans arbitrate.
- When a model changes behavior, deciding whether to adapt or wait.
- Avoiding brittle optimizations that break later.
What
cannot be automated responsibly (today)
9. Truth boundary & claims risk
- Deciding which claims are acceptable.
- Navigating legal, medical, financial risk.
- Knowing whennotto optimize for visibility.
This requires accountability.
10. Long-term narrative control
Models don’t just answer—they
frame
.
- Subtle shifts in how a brand is talked about matter.
- Humans are needed to detect “off but not wrong” positioning.
AI still lacks taste and judgment here.
Realistic automation ratio
| Area | Automation |
| --- | --- |
| Data collection & probing | ~100% |
| Analysis & scoring | ~95% |
| Content generation | ~85–90% |
| Deployment & iteration | ~95% |
| Strategy & ethics | ~20–30% |
Net result:
~80–90% agency automation is realistic.
What the agency actually becomes
Not a services company, but:
- Acontinuous optimization system
- With humans acting asgovernors, not operators
One strategist can oversee dozens of brands.
The hard truth
If this is built correctly:
- Most traditional agency roles disappear.
- The value moves toinfrastructure, datasets, and feedback loops.
- The “agency” is mostly a product.
One-line answer
Yes—almost everything can be automated,
except judgment, ethics, and long-term brand intent
, which must stay human.

## User

so this could be offered as an agentic saas with the client as a human in the loop?

---

## Assistant

Yes.
This is
almost the ideal use case
for an
agentic SaaS with the client as human-in-the-loop
.
Below is the
clean, realistic structure
—no hype.
What this becomes in product terms
An
autonomous system
that:
- continuously probes AI platforms,
- optimizes brand inclusion,
- and only escalates decisions that requireintent or accountability.
The client does
not operate
it — they
govern
it.
Core agent loop (fully autonomous)
Loop runs daily / weekly without human input
1. Prompt discovery agentGenerates new real-world prompt variantsDetects emerging intent clusters
  - Generates new real-world prompt variants
  - Detects emerging intent clusters
2. Visibility audit agentTests brand presence across AI platformsScores inclusion, framing, competitors
  - Tests brand presence across AI platforms
  - Scores inclusion, framing, competitors
3. Gap analysis agentIdentifies why competitors appearMaps missing content primitives
  - Identifies why competitors appear
  - Maps missing content primitives
4. Content synthesis agentGenerates or updates AI-native contentPrepares structured, citation-friendly assets
  - Generates or updates AI-native content
  - Prepares structured, citation-friendly assets
5. Deployment agentPublishes changes (CMS, docs, KBs)Versioned and reversible
  - Publishes changes (CMS, docs, KBs)
  - Versioned and reversible
6. Evaluation agentRe-probes modelsMeasures deltaFeeds learning back into the system
  - Re-probes models
  - Measures delta
  - Feeds learning back into the system
This loop is
infrastructure
, not UX.
Where the human steps in (by design)
1. Strategic approvals
The system proposes options, not decisions.
- “Increase comparative aggressiveness vs Competitor A?”
- “Shift framing from ‘affordable’ to ‘expert’?”
Human clicks
approve / reject / adjust
.
2. Risk & ethics checkpoints
Hard gates.
- Claims touching health, finance, legality
- Reputation-sensitive third-party mentions
- Over-optimization warnings
Nothing ships without explicit consent.
3. Brand worldview calibration
Quarterly or monthly.
- Desired tone
- Red lines
- Long-term narrative direction
This sets the
policy layer
for all agents.
Client UX (very important)
The client does
not
see:
- prompts
- embeddings
- agents
- pipelines
They see:
A. Control panel
- “Where do we appear?”
- “Where should we appear?”
- “What changed since last week?”
B. Decision inbox
- High-impact choices only
- Each with simulated outcomes
- One-click approval
C. Trust indicators
- Why the system did or did not act
- Confidence ranges, not promises
- Clear rollback paths
Why this works as SaaS (not agency)
| Agency | Agentic SaaS |
| --- | --- |
| Manual effort | Autonomous loops |
| Billable hours | Continuous value |
| Hard to scale | Near-zero marginal cost |
| Talent-heavy | Infrastructure-heavy |
| Subjective | Measurable inclusion deltas |
Pricing logic (realistic)
You are
not selling ads
.
You are selling
probability of being the answer
.
Typical pricing vectors:
- Number of tracked prompt clusters
- Number of AI platforms
- Frequency of probing
- Risk tier (regulated vs non-regulated)
This supports
€200–€2,000+/month
cleanly.
Critical constraint (don’t ignore)
You must
never promise
:
- guaranteed mentions
- rankings
- deterministic outcomes
You sell:
- monitoring
- optimization
- adaptive learning
Anything else is dishonest.
Bottom line
Yes.
This should be built as an
agentic SaaS
where:
- agents do the work
- the client sets intent and accountability
- humans intervene only where machines shouldn’t decide
If you try to keep it as a service, you are leaving scale on the table.

## User

is this feasable to build as a solopreneur who wants to build a product that provides value to the users

---

## Assistant

Yes —
this is feasible for a solopreneur
,
if
you scope it correctly and accept a few hard constraints.
Below is a
truthful feasibility assessment
, not a pitch.
The honest feasibility picture
Technically
- Yes. Nothing here requires novel research.
- You are composing existing capabilities:LLMs, prompt orchestration, schedulers, evaluators, dashboards.
Commercially
- Yes, but only if you sellmonitoring + decision support first, not “optimization magic”.
Operationally
- Yes, if the product is:opinionatednarrowautomated by default
  - opinionated
  - narrow
  - automated by default
If you try to build “the full vision” first, it will fail.
What makes this
solo-feasible
1. The core loop is simple
At its smallest viable form:
Run prompts → record answers → detect brand mentions → show deltas
That alone is already valuable.
You do
not
need:
- content deployment
- third-party seeding
- reinforcement loopson day one.
2. You can start as
read-only intelligence
This is the key move.
Phase 1: AI Visibility Monitor (MVP)
- Track brand presence across AI tools
- Track competitors
- Alert on changes
This already solves a real anxiety:
“Are we invisible in AI answers?”
3. Human-in-the-loop reduces your burden
You do
not
need perfect automation.
Let the product:
- propose actions
- explain reasoning
- wait for approval
This shifts liability and complexity away from you.
4. Narrow the initial customer profile
This does
not
work for everyone.
Best early adopters:
- B2B SaaS
- developer tools
- marketplaces
- brands with educational content
Avoid initially:
- medical
- legal
- financial advice
- heavily regulated industries
What you
should not
try to build alone (yet)
Be very strict here.
❌ Cross-model “memory shaping” claims
❌ Guaranteed inclusion promises
❌ Fully autonomous content publishing
❌ Reputation manipulation systems
❌ Multi-platform perfection (pick 1–2)
Trying any of these early will kill you.
Realistic solo build plan (90-day path)
Month 1 — Monitoring
- Prompt library per niche
- Scheduled probing (ChatGPT-like systems)
- Mention detection + basic scoring
- Simple dashboard
Value exists already.
Month 2 — Insight
- Competitor comparison
- Framing analysis
- Change detection
- Weekly summaries
Now it’s worth paying for.
Month 3 — Assisted action
- “Why you didn’t appear” explanations
- Content recommendations (not publishing)
- Human approval UI
Now it feels agentic.
Time & energy reality
Expect:
- 3–6 months to first real value
- Manual support at first
- Iterative trust-building with users
This is not passive income.
It
is
leverage.
Why this is a good solopreneur product
- Clear pain, growing fast
- Low initial surface area
- Strong differentiation
- Becomes defensible via data, not code
- Can stay small and profitable
You don’t need a unicorn.
You need
€5–15k MRR
from users who
trust
you.
The biggest risk (be aware)
Not technical.
Narrative risk
:
- Overhyping “AI influence”
- Users expecting control over models
You must position this as:
“Observability and optimization, not control.”
Bottom line
Yes, this is feasible
and sensible
for a solopreneur
if
:
- you start with monitoring, not manipulation
- you design for human governance
- you stay honest about limits
This is a product where
restraint
is the competitive advantage.
