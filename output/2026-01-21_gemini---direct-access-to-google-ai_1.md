## User

How can I get my model to think like me

---

## User

Instead of all of that what about creating a a system in which i can upload my chats with a chatbot discussing a certain topic. then feed that chat into an extraction pipeline, thst analyses, disects, extends and repurposes my comversation to extract my thinking pattern.
then save that thinking pattern into a graph db system then have it answer queries by constructing meta cognitive reasoning steps from that db before answering queries

---

## User

Would it be possible to ‚clone‘ a user by constructing a quiz that the user answers in conversation with a chatbot and have only that chat be used as input to the pipeline?

---

## User

What about using such a digital clone to prompt through an agentic workflow loop reviewing and refining chatbot output

---

## User

Make a critical analysis of the presented framework

---

## User

How about using this as a layer to extract information for branding strategy from a client brief by injecting my thinking patterns I use when reading a brief

---

## User

Could the extracted brief insights be then used to generate a truly creative strategy formulated completely by this agent

---

## User

could a quiz as discussed earlier and the following processing of the answers be enough to extract thinking patterns and behavioural insights to the point that the "clone" would be able to process new information exactly the same way the original would?

---

## User

couldn't you construct the quiz in a way that would extract the core subconscious insights and pattern even if the subject is not aware of them? so even if they answer something in one way the system would be able to see whether or not the answer from the subject was accurate and in line with subconscious patterns.

## User

thinking more about reasoning and how humans practically interact with chatbots in order to judge/filter/refine their output. would it be correct to assume that humans do this by implicitely repeating thinking patterns to assess llm output?

---

## User

to achieve this, the thinking and reasnoning pattern of the user would have to be extracted first, correct?

---

## User

what about how exactly the user thinks about a problem? the internal steps they take to come to a conclusion or hypothesis, which measures they use to test it, how intensely they test it. for which cases they adjust. when they are flexible in their approach. how they abstract and how they specify back into the problem. when they accept exceptions. and everything else. this extraction system would need to be very robust and modular as I am sure it would be subject to many modifications / additions over time.

---

## User

evaluate the viability of this architecture and assess if you would recommend going this route or if you think it would be a waste of time and if there are already better alternatives

---

## User

is it truly that big of an effort? ponder upon the idea to use an extraction pipeline that auto formats all the users answers into the framework and puts each extracted insghts into the right thinking patter "box"

---

## User

so could you answer the question before again?

---

## User

how did you assume this was handled initially? wasn't it automated from the beginning?

---

## User

okay sounds good to me. which nodes would you add into this system to reflect an users entire psyche or as much as possible of their reasoning

- How to do it:Create a system prompt that includes a section titled "My Core Principles" or "Decision Framework."
- Example:"When analyzing a business problem, I always prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains and value transparency above all else."
- The Workflow:You upload your personal documents (journals, blog posts, project notes) to a database.When you ask a question, the system retrieves relevant snippets of your writing to inform its response.
- Why it works:It prevents the model from "hallucinating" a generic personality and keeps it tethered to your actual voice and past logic.
- Best for:Achieving a specific "voice" or unique professional expertise that general models lack.

| Feature | Generic Model | "You" Aligned Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tone | Neutral and helpful | Matches your specific level of formality/humor |
| Priorities | General safety/utility | Your specific goals (e.g., speed, depth, or creativity) |
| Bias | Averaged from the internet | Reflects your specific worldview and values |

1. Values:What do you care about? (e.g., "I value brevity," "I hate corporate jargon," "I am an optimist.")
2. Context:What is your background? (e.g., "I am a software engineer with a focus on security," or "I am a parent who prioritizes work-life balance.")
3. Logical Constraints:How do you solve problems? (e.g., "Always look for the simplest solution first," or "Consider the emotional impact on the team before the technical feasibility.")
1. Point out the error:"I wouldn't have used that word; it sounds too formal."
2. Explain the 'Why':"I prefer to sound more approachable to my team."
3. Update the System Prompt:Add that feedback into the model's permanent instructions.

- Input:A JSON export of your chat history.
- The "Miner" Prompt:"Analyze the user's response in this segment. Ignore the specific topic (e.g., coding, cooking). Instead, extract theabstract logical stepsthe user took to solve the problem. Identify their:Axioms:What fundamental truths do they assume? (e.g., 'Speed is better than perfection').Heuristics:What mental shortcuts did they use? (e.g., 'If X is ambiguous, assume Y').Priorities:When two values conflicted, which one won?"
- Output:A structured JSON object representing a "Thought Circuit."
1. Axioms:What fundamental truths do they assume? (e.g., 'Speed is better than perfection').
2. Heuristics:What mental shortcuts did they use? (e.g., 'If X is ambiguous, assume Y').
3. Priorities:When two values conflicted, which one won?"

1. Query Analysis:The system classifies your new prompt (e.g., "This is aStrategic Dilemma").
2. Graph Retrieval:It queries the Graph DB:"Find the reasoning path the user typically applies toStrategic Dilemmas."Retrieves:(Strategy) -> [CHECK_RISK_FIRST] -> [IGNORE_SUNK_COSTS].
  - Retrieves:(Strategy) -> [CHECK_RISK_FIRST] -> [IGNORE_SUNK_COSTS].
3. Prompt Construction:It dynamically builds a system instruction:"You are the user's cognitive twin. To answer this question, youmustfollow this reasoning path: First assess risks, then explicitly ignore any sunk costs. Only then propose a solution."
4. Final Generation:The LLM generates the answer using your borrowed brain.

- Orchestration:LangChain or LlamaIndex.
- Database:Neo4j (best for graph structures) or a lightweight NetworkX (Python) for testing.
- LLM:GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet (needed for the high-level extraction logic).

```ng-tns-c3928062779-40
# Step 1: Extract Reasoning
chat_log = load_chat("my_debate_on_politics.txt")
reasoning_triples = extractor_llm.extract(chat_log, target="logical_flow")
# Output: [("Complex Topic", "REQUIRES", "First Principles Analysis"), ...]

# Step 2: Ingest into Graph
graph_db.add(reasoning_triples)

# Step 3: The "Twin" Chat Loop
user_query = "Should I quit my job to start a startup?"

# 3a. Retrieve Thinking Pattern
similar_context = vector_search(user_query) # e.g., finds "High Stakes Decision"
reasoning_path = graph_db.get_path(context="High Stakes Decision")
# Returns: "Identify Worst Case" -> "Maximize Upside" -> "Ignore Social Pressure"

# 3b. Answer
final_answer = llm.predict(
    instruction=f"Answer the user. Use this exact logic flow: {reasoning_path}",

)

```

- It's Explainable:You can look at the graph and seeexactlywhy the model made a decision ("Oh, it followed my 'Risk Aversion' path").
- It's Modifiable:If your thinking changes, you just edit the graph node, rather than retraining a whole model.
- It's Transferable:You can apply your "Marketing Thinking Pattern" to a "Coding Problem" to see what happens (cross-domain synthesis).

- Passive Chat:You might casually agree with someone. The model learns nothing about your conviction.
- Active Quiz:The bot presents a dilemma where two of your values collide (e.g., "Brutal Honesty" vs. "Team Morale"). Your answer reveals yourhierarchy of values.
- Mechanism:The bot presents a scenario with no clear "right" answer.
- The "Why" Loop:After you answer, the bot challenges you. "You chose option A, but that risks X. Why is X acceptable to you?"
- Goal:To force you to articulate theaxiombehind the decision.
- User says:"I’d launch the product with bugs rather than miss the deadline, because we can patch later, but we can't un-miss a market window."
- Extractor sees:IF (Deadline_Risk > Quality_Risk) THEN (Prioritize Speed)
- Tag:Philosophy: Imperfectionist / First-Mover

```

- Goal:Establish your non-negotiables.
- Sample Question:"In a project, do you respect the hierarchy of command, or do you respect the person with the best idea, even if it causes friction with management?"
- Extracts:Authority bias vs. Meritocracy bias.
- Goal:Learn your mental shortcuts for quick decisions.
- Sample Question:"You receive an email that is 5 paragraphs long. Do you read it all, or scan for keywords? If you scan, what words catch your eye?"
- Extracts:Information processing style (Deep diver vs. Skimmer).
- Goal:Mimic how you structure arguments.
- Sample Question:"Explain the concept of 'Risk' to a 5-year-old, and then explain it to a PhD student."
- Extracts:Vocabulary range, metaphor usage, and tone adaptability.

1. The Worker Agent (Generic LLM):A standard, high-capability model (e.g., GPT-4o). Its job is to generate the "First Draft." It focuses on speed and basic competence.
2. The Clone Agent (The Supervisor):A model grounded in yourReasoning Graph. Its job isnotto write, but toaudit. It reads the draft, compares it against your specific heuristics, and rejects it if it doesn't "feel" like you.
- Worker Agent:Generates a standard, apologetic, corporate-sounding email.
- Query:"How does the user handle angry clients?"
- Retrieval from Graph:(Client_Conflict) --[REQUIRES]--> (Radical_Transparency)AND(Tone) --[AVOIDS]--> (Over_Apologizing).

```
(Client_Conflict) --[REQUIRES]--> (Radical_Transparency)
```


```

```

- Clone Output:"The draft is too apologetic.Rejection Reason:My profile specifies 'Radical Transparency' over appeasement.Instruction:Remove the phrase 'we are deeply sorry' and replace it with a clear explanation of exactly what went wrong. Keep it under 100 words."
1. It separates "Competence" from "Style":The Worker Agent handles the heavy lifting (grammar, facts, structure). The Clone Agent focuses purely onalignment(tone, ethics, priorities). This is computationally more efficient.
2. It prevents "Drift":Standard chatbots revert to their training (being nice and average). The Clone acts as a guardrail that constantly pushes the output back toward your specific idiosyncrasies.
3. Active Training:You can review thecritiquesthe Clone gave. If the Clone critiques something wrongly, you update the Graph, effectively "teaching the teacher."
- Your Graph contains:(Code_Style) --[PREFERS]--> (Readability) --[OVER]--> (One_Liners)
- Worker Agent:Generates a complex, clever Python one-liner list comprehension.
- Clone Agent:"Rejection: This is too dense. My profile prioritizes readability. Rewrite this as a standardforloop with comments."

- The Critique:Humans are unreliable narrators of their own cognitive processes. When you answer a quiz question like "Do you prefer speed or quality?", you are likely to answer with yourAspirational Self(who youwantto be) rather than yourActual Self(how you actually behave under pressure).
- The Consequence:The "Clone" Supervisor might enforce a standard of perfectionism that youclaimto value but rarely practice. This creates a friction loop where the Agent rejects valid drafts because they don't meet an idealized standard you set for yourself but don't actually follow.
- Mitigation:The system needs "Passive Calibration." It must ingestactualsent emails/code, not just quiz answers, to weight "Real Behavior" higher than "Stated Beliefs."
- The Critique:Human thought is fluid and often contradictory. You might value "Brevity" in emails but "Depth" in documentation. If the Graph Schema is too simple (e.g.,User PREFERS Brevity), the Agent will mistakenly truncate complex reports. If the Schema is too complex (context-dependent nodes), the "Extraction Pipeline" becomes brittle and prone to error.
- The Consequence:The model becomes "Brittlely Aligned." It follows rules so strictly that it loses common sense, failing to recognize when a specific context warrants breaking a rule (a "Zero-Inference" failure).

```
User PREFERS Brevity
```

- The Critique:LLMs are excellent atrationalization—creating a logical-sounding reason for a decision that was actually intuitive or emotional. If you ask an LLMwhyyou made a decision in a text, it will often invent a plausible heuristic that you never actually used.
- The Consequence:Your Knowledge Graph gets filled with "Fake Logic"—sophisticated-sounding rules that don't actually govern your behavior. The Clone then starts making decisions based on these hallucinations rather than your actual intuition.
- The Workflow:User Prompt ->Worker Drafts (3s) ->Supervisor Retrieves Rules (0.5s) ->Supervisor Critiques (2s) ->Worker Refines (3s) ->Output.
  1. User Prompt ->

  3. Supervisor Retrieves Rules (0.5s) ->
  4. Supervisor Critiques (2s) ->
  5. Worker Refines (3s) ->
  6. Output.
- The Critique:A simple request now takes ~8-10 seconds. For real-time chat, this is unacceptable.
- The Solution:This architecture is viable forasynchronous tasks(e.g., "Draft this report while I get coffee") but fails forsynchronous conversation(e.g., "Quick, what should I say?").
1. User Prompt ->
2. Worker Drafts (3s) ->
3. Supervisor Retrieves Rules (0.5s) ->
4. Supervisor Critiques (2s) ->
5. Worker Refines (3s) ->
6. Output.
- The Critique:Much of what makes "You" think like "You" is tacit knowledge—instincts, muscle memory, and subconscious pattern recognition that cannot be verbalized in a chat or quiz.
- The Consequence:The system will successfully clone yourexplicitpolicy (your bureaucracy) but fail to clone yourgenius(your intuition). It risks creating a "Bureaucratic Twin" that enforces your rules without your insight.

1. Speed to Insight:You skip the first 2 hours of "figuring out what matters." The system highlights thetensionimmediately.
2. Consistency:You ensure you never miss a "Red Flag" (e.g., mismatched deliverables vs. budget) because your "BS Detector" heuristic runs every single time.
3. Scalability:You can have junior staff run the brief throughyourpipeline. They enter the meeting already knowing whatyouwould likely focus on.

1. Diverge:Explode the brief into many wild possibilities.
2. Converge:Select the best one and build a tight narrative around it.
- The Input:The "Strategic Truths" extracted from the brief (e.g., "The audience feels ignored by big tech").
- The Mechanism:This agent runs at a higher "Temperature" (randomness setting, e.g., 0.8 or 0.9).
- The "Creative Frameworks" Injection:Instead of just "thinking," the agent is forced to apply your favorite creative frameworks (stored in your Graph DB).Framework A (The Villain):"Define an enemy for this brand. It shouldn't be a competitor; it should be a concept (e.g., 'Boredom', 'Complexity')."Framework B (The Cross-Pollination):"If this brand were a religion/cult/dictatorship, what would its first commandment be?"

- Latency:The "Shadow-Verifier" loop (Generate → Simulate → Compare → Refine) will take 15–30 seconds per response. This is unusable for chat, though fine for asynchronous work (e.g., "Draft this report while I sleep").
- Maintenance Hell:You are trading the "Black Box" of an LLM for the "Spaghetti Code" of a massive Graph Database. If your thinking changes (e.g., you become more risk-tolerant), you have to manually prune conflict nodes in your database.
- Viability:Extremely High.
- Pros:It captures your"Vibe"(tone, slang, sentence length) perfectly. It is fast and cheap.
- Cons:It doesnotcapture your logic. It mimics theshapeof your answers, not thereasoning. It will confidently hallucinate a decision you would never make, but it will sound exactly like you doing it.
- Verdict:Better for "Chatting," worse for "Decision Making."
- Viability:High.
- Pros:Zero infrastructure cost. Easy to edit.
- Cons:Context window limits (though less of an issue now). LLMs struggle to follow >20 complex rules simultaneously ("Lost in the Middle" phenomenon).
- Verdict:The best starting point.
- Viability:Niche.
- Pros:Theonlyway to get reliablegovernanceandlogicalignment. If you need the bot to make financial decisions or strategic rejections on your behalf, youneedthis structure.
- Cons:Over-engineering.

- Task:It looks for contradictions.
- Scenario:Last week you said "Speed over Quality." Today you said "Perfect code is mandatory."
- Action:It doesn't crash. It creates a"Conflict Ticket"and asks you a single clarifying question:"You have a conflict in your logic regarding Quality. Which Context triggers which rule?"
- Result:You answer once, and the Gardener updates the logic tree.

- Manual Approach (Old Verdict):You spend 100 hours manually updating rules. The system degrades as you change.(Waste of Time).
- Automated Approach (New Verdict):You spend 10-20 hours setting up the Pipeline + Schema. You then spend 0 hours extracting. Every conversation you haveincreasesthe system's fidelity automatically. The asset appreciates in value over time without extra labor.(High ROI).
- Even if the "Clone" chatbot fails, theGraph Databaseitself becomes incredibly valuable. You can query it:"What is my historical bias regarding hiring?"and get an answer derived from data you didn't even know you provided.
- This makes the project valuablebeforethe clone is even perfect.
- Thebuildingof the brain is now fast (automated).
- Theusingof the brain (the Shadow-Verifier loop) is still slow (requires multiple LLM calls per answer).
- Fix:You don't use the full loop for everything. You build a "Router" that only activates the full "Shadow Brain" for complex questions, while simple hellos bypass it.

1. Define the Schema (Day 1):Write the JSON structure for your thoughts. (e.g.,Class ThoughtPattern: trigger, action, exception).
2. Build the "Ingestion Script" (Day 2):A Python script that takes chat logs, runs them through an LLM with your Schema, and dumps the JSON into a Vector/Graph DB.
3. Run the "History Load" (Day 3):Feed your last 6 months of existing chat logs (Telegram/Slack/WhatsApp) into the script.Result:You wake up to a populated "Mind" without having answered a single quiz question yet.
  - Result:You wake up to a populated "Mind" without having answered a single quiz question yet.
4. The "Gardener" Routine (Ongoing):Once a week, you review the "Conflicting Patterns" the AI found (e.g.,"You claim to like speed, but you stalled on Project X"). You resolve them, refining the Clone's accuracy.

- The Workflow I imagined:You feed chat logs -> LLM extracts "insights" -> Graph DB gets flooded with thousands of "soft" nodes (e.g.,User likes coffee,User prefers speed,User hates waiting).
- The Failure Mode:Over time, this graph becomes atangled mess of contradictions.Monday:You say "I want perfect code."Tuesday:You say "Ship it now, fix it later."
  - Monday:You say "I want perfect code."
  - Tuesday:You say "Ship it now, fix it later."
- The "Manual" Burden:I assumedYOUwould have to step in to manually untangle this web, deleting old nodes and resolving conflicts to keep the "Clone" consistent.Thatis the waste of time.

```

```

```

- Monday:You say "I want perfect code."
- Tuesday:You say "Ship it now, fix it later."
- The Workflow you clarified:You define rigid classes first (Axiom,Context_Exception,Heuristic). The LLM isforbiddenfrom creating new types of nodes; it can only fill the existing boxes.
- The Result:The system doesn't just store "User likes speed." It stores:Heuristic: SpeedConstraint: Low_Stakes_Project
  - Heuristic: Speed
  - Constraint: Low_Stakes_Project
- Why this removes the labor:Because the data enters the systempre-sorted and context-tagged, the "Conflict Resolution" (Gardening) can be automated. The system knowswhyMonday's command contradicted Tuesday's command (different Contexts), so it doesn't need to ask you to fix it.
